DLQueue
Solid principle,
Kafka
	How you configure kafka
	What is zookeeper
	How consumer reads the missed data
Java 8 functional interface
Comparator, Comparable
	Example
API Gateway and Circuit breaker
Intermediatery and terminal interface
Can you serialize static fields

Linkk Group | ANB Bank

How you break product in microservices and define boundaries between them
Onion layer
Benefits of ORM
	- Suppose you have migrated from MySQL to Postgres. if You have not used ORM what changes will be needed in your application code.
		- said no need to change the application code as ORM easily facilitates DB migrations
	- Author to Article
	- Article to Categories (Many to Many)
		- How you define this many to many relationships in your spring code?
		- How does this look like in Java Code?
		- will there be 3rd table and entity in your code?
Have you ever worked on Event based project architecture
	- How you decide if you want to go ahead with event based calls or synchronous calls
	- Asked example of amazon
	- If you want to notify the user for his purchase. Which method will you choose. Sync or Async?
Locking in database
	- Said optimistic/pessimistic calls.
How you implement the same using Spring
	- Said transactions

------------------------------------------

1. Online Test
--------------

    - Online test gorilla was given in which they asked Quants Questions, Core Java, Spring
    (AOP, various annotations), Kafka MCQs, Rest MCQs, Microservices MCQs
    - Quants Questions Example
        a. If n persons finish a task in 10 days then how many days will be taken by m
        b. A week schedule was given for some person. Person A will work when person B and C works.
        When person B will have holiday? Kind of questions.

2. Round One Interview Questions
--------------------------------

    1. Hashmap vs Concurrent hash map
        If we just synchronize hash map method will it become chm?
        Why we use binary tree in hashmap for storing data
    2. Retry topic vs DL topic in Kafka
    3. Which cloud deployment product you are using
    4. New features of Java 17
        What are records in java 17
        If there is a list in a record, is it immutable?
    5. Isolation levels in transaction (Uncommited, Committed, REPEATABLE READ and Synchronized)
        - What are the problems for which isolation is applied
        - If you pick an entity from a service with Transactional annotation and send that entity to
        another service and use save method there will it save the same to db or throw an error?
    6. Various entity states in Hibernate?
    7. If there are 2 instances of ms which update the same row to the db how can you achieve the same:
        said optimistic lock. He asked will it lock just a row or an entire table?
    8. In distributes architecture, what happens if any of the service fails?
        How you design such possibility?
        I Said SAGA:
            - Which one you implemented? (Orchestration or choreograpgy)?
    9. Problem: Given String "a1b2c3d4"
    Print: "abbcccdddd" in less than n square complexity
        - Explained 2 approaches.
            a. Simple for loop character wise
            b. Using stack
        - Both will have linear time complexity. As the numbers in the string will take constant TC.
    10. Re-balancing complexity of BST? : O(log n)

3. Round Two Interview Questions
---------------------------------

    1. Tell me about a project where you have developed microservices based app.
    2. What was the design patterns used component used
    3. How they used to do inter-service communication
    4. How you design microservices based product from the scratch
        - Was expecting DDD. Later on asked whats DDD?
    4. Kafka
        a. How consumer deals with application failures picks the right message?
        b. ack =0,1,all meaning?
    5. Difference between SAGA Orchestration and Choreography
    6. What's P in CAP theorem?
    7. Convert a statement in words without using library functions.

RemoteOne | Unknown (Saudi Arabia) | Screening Round | 5th March
------------------------------------------------------------------

    1. Tell me about yourself. Projects, experience, technical expertise.
    2. Tell me about your technical expertise and when was the last time you used?
    3. Which module in Framework, Java have you used so far?
    4. Have you faced any challenge and how you solved that?
    5. This role needs AI Knowledge.
        - said I dont have prior experience
        - interviewer asked what's the way you choose to learn something new?
    6. Asked salary expectations

----------------------------
Array | Bahrain | 7th March
----------------------------

Tell me about yourself
Tell me about your work part. Explain how transfers and payment works.
Why you have so many switches?

Kafka

	What are main components of kafka?
	How kafka provides fault tolerence
	What is the process of leader selection?
	How to debug a consumer. To know if the consumer is slow?

Core java

	1. Hashmap vs hashtable
	2. ArrayList vs LinkedList
	3. Main interfaces implementing List interface
		OR major implementations of List
	4. Benefits of collections in Java?
	5. Various generations of a heap memory?
	6. Java 17 major features
	7. Immutable objects?

Coding Questions

1. Print prime numbers between 1 to 100
2. Rotate a matrix 90 degree
3. Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together
	Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
	Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]
